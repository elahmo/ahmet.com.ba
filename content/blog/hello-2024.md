# Hello World 2024

Hey again, now in 2024! 

Time flies really quickly, who would've thought that it has been almost five 
years since I had the intention of resuming my blog and internet presence.

 <!--more-->

A lot of things have happened in the meantime, and I am really happy to be back
tinkering on this website. As with last time, this will be used to share my
thoughts, projects, and other things that I find interesting.

New this time is a cool a proper domain name, novalic.xyx, which has already
been running for a while with a few backend applications. I will share more
about those in the coming weeks.

In any case, if you end up reading this, thank you for stopping by, I hope to
see you again here.
